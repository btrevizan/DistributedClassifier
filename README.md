# Distributed Classifier
Framework for evaluation and analysis of distributed classification using several aggregation methods for binary and multiclass classification problems.

The results show that there is no aggregation method that performs better in every case. 
Its performance depends on the problem’s intrinsic characteristics.
With this information, we were able to create a model that can be used as [practical tool](https://github.com/btrevizan/aggrm_predictor) to guide the 
choice of the aggregation method for vertically partitioned machine learning problems.
